My First React Project

This project is my first attempt at creating a website using React. I followed a tutorial by Traversy Media, which was incredibly helpful in understanding the basics of React, including how to use it and, most importantly, why it's useful.

So what this website does is:
Lets you see a set of React developer jobs which i had as a set in json file in the backend

Edit or add or delete a job.

Key Takeaways
Understanding React: This project helped me grasp the core concepts of React and its component-based architecture.

Building Confidence: Completing this project boosted my confidence in using React for web development.

GitHub Upload: This is also my first time uploading a large project to GitHub. I may have included some unnecessary files, but it was a valuable learning experience.

Feel free to explore the project and provide any feedback. Thank you!
