# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

My First React Project

This project is my first attempt at creating a website using React. I followed a tutorial by Traversy Media, which was incredibly helpful in understanding the basics of React, including how to use it and, most importantly, why it's useful.

Key Takeaways
Understanding React: This project helped me grasp the core concepts of React and its component-based architecture.

Building Confidence: Completing this project boosted my confidence in using React for web development.

GitHub Upload: This is also my first time uploading a large project to GitHub. I may have included some unnecessary files, but it was a valuable learning experience.

Feel free to explore the project and provide any feedback. Thank you!
